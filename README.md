Front-end web dev assignment

### Task
Use Backbone.js to create a simple single page web app that let users find all course offerings for next term (Fall 2015) by accessing data from UW Open Data API, and create persistent lists of selected courses that he/she is interested in for future reference.

### Goal
- Show that you can learn by yourself
- Show that you know how RESTful APIs work and are able to use them in your web app
- Showcase your skills to work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Get your hands dirty with front-end MV* and JavaScript frameworks
- Have some basic understanding of the kind of front-end developing work we are doing at EasyAce

### Note
We don't really use Backbone.js at EasyAce, but it's simple, light weight, easy to learn, and has the basic tools/features of a front-end MV* framework. If you can use Backbone.js, learning a more complicated, full flavor framework becomes much easier.
