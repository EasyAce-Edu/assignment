##Requirements

You must use Backbone.js as the framework to build your single page web app

You must use UW Open Data API as the only data source (If you don't have an API key, create one)

You must use Backbone's collections and model to communicate with the API (e.g. no direct jQuery Ajax calls)

You must use Backbone's views to render UI and display models

You must use some sort of templating, although you are free to choose the template engine you like (the default underscore is fine, you can use something else e.g. mustache, handlebar, etc., too)

You must handle events in your Backbone views, do not write jQuery code to bind event listener manually

###Your web app must support some sort of navigation to help users find a course easily (dropdowns of subjects, search, etc.)

###For the courses, your app must display some of their information, e.g. time, days, title, description, etc, that users have some understanding of what they are

###You must use some kind of local storage that a user can create a list, add courses to it, save it, and load it back in future browser sessions (close/reopen browser)

###Your web app must be able to store multiple lists, although you don't need to worry about security

Feel free to use file/module loader, you may get a bonus for better structure of your code

Feel free to use any 3rd party library/package you want

Feel free to design your UI, you have the total authority, and of course the elegancy/beautifulness/usability of your UI will be evaluated

###Feel free to add extra features, this is an open end task, take advantage of your freedom

You can either link all your resources locally, all from some online vendors, the testing machine will have internet access
